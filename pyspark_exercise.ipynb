On the other hand, reduce is an action that aggregates all the elements of the RDD using some function and returns the final result to the driver program (although there is also a parallel reduceByKey that returns a distributed dataset)."

The Spark documentation suggests 2-4 partitions (which they also seem to call slices) per CPU. Often there are 100-10,000 partitions. Another rule of thumb is that tasks should take at least 100 ms. If less than that, you may want to repartition to have fewer partitions."
